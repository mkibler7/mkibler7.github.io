      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>As a graduate of Southern New Hampshire University’s Computer Science program, this ePortfolio is a reflection of my growth, knowledge, and professional readiness. Over the course of this program, I have evolved from a beginner in code structure and logic to a confident software developer capable of engineering scalable solutions and critically assessing algorithmic efficiency. This ePortfolio highlights the key areas of my expertise: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Together, they demonstrate my ability to deliver quality software that meets both user and business needs.</p>
      <p>My academic journey emphasized hands-on learning and practical application. I collaborated on team-based projects, communicated design decisions to both technical and non-technical audiences, and applied computer science theories to real-world systems. My focus on algorithm optimization, secure coding practices, and cross-platform development has prepared me for the challenges of today’s technology landscape. Through enhancing my project artifacts, I showcased my adaptability and dedication to writing efficient, secure, and maintainable code. These experiences not only sharpened my technical skills but also shaped my professional values and long-term goals: to build reliable, user-focused software that solves meaningful problems.</p>
