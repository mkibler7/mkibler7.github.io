      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>  As an almost graduate of Southern New Hampshire University’s Computer Science program, this ePortfolio is meant to serve as a showcase for my educational growth and developed skills. 
        Throughout the last couple of years, I have evolved from a beginner in code structure and logic to a confident software developer capable of engineering scalable solutions and critically assessing algorithmic efficiency. 
        This ePortfolio highlights areas I have developed my skills, suchg as software design/engineering, algorithms/data structures, and backend databases. All together, they help to demonstrate my ability to deliver professional, quality software.</p>
      <p>  My academic journey put an emphasize on hands-on learning and practical application. I was able to communicate design decisions to both technical and non-technical audiences and apply computer science theories and algorithms to
        real-world systems. I believe that my focus on algorithm optimization, secure coding practices, and cross-platform development has helped to prepare me for the challenges of today’s tech industry. 
        From the enhancements made through my capstone project, I effectively showcased my ability to write efficient, secure, and maintainable code.</p>
